# Module1 Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to learn how to code with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I built this as the first homework assignment. This solves the problem of not having a fully working webpage. I learned some basics of how to code in the required languages.

## Usage

This can be used as a guiding tool in regards to SEO, ORM, and SMM. The webpage now has fully functioning links to each part of the webpage. The semantics are now also updated to function correctly when needed. Image descriptions are also added for visibilty. Footer date is updated.
